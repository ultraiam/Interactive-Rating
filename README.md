## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I'll update the code to match the solution a little bit more, but for now this is what I have. 

I learned how to use the javascript elements and selectors to pull and push the components when they were clicked. This challenged me and is really helping me understand how HTML, CSS, and Javascript come together. 

### Continued development

I plan on continuing to learn the javascript elements, selectors, and syntax until I'm just as proficient as I am with HTML and CSS markups. 

### Useful resources

Thanks to @tsbsankara on YouTube for making a guide to this because I did get stuck writing the JavaScript portion of this component.
