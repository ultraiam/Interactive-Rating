## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to use the javascript elements and selectors to pull and push the components when they were clicked. This challenged me and is really helping me understand how HTML, CSS, and Javascript come together. 

### Continued development

I plan on continuing to learn the javascript elements, selectors, and syntax until I'm just as proficient as I am with HTML and CSS markups. 

### Useful resources
